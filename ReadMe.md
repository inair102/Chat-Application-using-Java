#Chat Application using Java

##Description:
This is a **Chat application** which is developed using the Java IO concepts - [Blocking IO](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-io/index.html) and [Non-Blocking IO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_I/O_(Java)). It runs on three different terminal tabs/windows:
<ul>
<li>First is the server which wilp handle the communication between the other two terminals - <strong>ChatServer</strong>
<li>Second and  Third are the chatting windows, where users can exchange messages through each other - <strong>Chat</strong>
</ul>

##How to Run:
Steps to run this application is as follows:
<ul>
1. First open three terminal windows/tabs.<br>
2. On one terminal run <strong>ChatServer</strong>.<br>
3. On second and third terminal run <strong>Chat</strong> with either blocking IO or non-blocking IO or both.<br>
Eg:- <strong>$ java Chat blocking</strong> and <strong>$ java Chat nonblocking</strong><br>
4. To Terminate, press Ctrl+C on any window and the connection will automatically disconnect/terminate.
</ul>
